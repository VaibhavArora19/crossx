## How to use

It is very easy to deploy the contract on multiple chains using crossx. You just need to open your hardhat folder where your contracts located and install the crossx package using the following commands.

```
npm install crossx

        or

yarn add crossx
```

After installing, just run this command

```
npx crossx
```

This will compile your solidity code and generates a unique link of crossx, just open this link in browser and connect your wallet, select chains and deploy the contract by paying the gas fees on only one chain.
